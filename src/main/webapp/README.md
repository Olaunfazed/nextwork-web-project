## Introduction

This project introduces the creation and deployment of a Java-based web application using AWS cloud services and CI/CD tools.

The deployment pipeline I'm building for this Java web app automates the software release process, making development more efficient and reliable.

<br>

## Technologies

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using in this project:

- **Amazon EC2**: I'm developing the web application directly on EC2 virtual servers, allowing cloud-based development and testing.
- **VS Code**: Using the Remote - SSH extension, I connect my IDE directly to my EC2 instance for seamless file editing and management.
- **GitHub**: My web app source code is version-controlled and stored here in this repository.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeArtifact**: This service will store artifacts and dependencies, improving build reliability and speed.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeBuild**: This will handle the build process ‚Äî compiling, testing, and packaging the app automatically.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodeDeploy**: Will automate the deployment of the built application across one or more EC2 instances.
- **[COMING SOON] AWS CodePipeline**: This will tie everything together, from code commit to deployment, providing an automated DevOps workflow.
